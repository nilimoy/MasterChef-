With inspired dishes like Masai Giraffe Swiss Roll and Wilderness Camp Rocky Road Chocolate Cake, Basecamp Head chef Benson Ole Soit has become renowned for his culinary skills. His high standards have set a new paradigm within Basecamp Kitchen. A self-taught chef, Benson’s story is an inspiring one of someone who fought against all odds to follow his passion of becoming a professional Chef.

Benson grew up in Koiyaki sub location in Narok County. Just after completing his primary school level his life took a turn. He was unable to peruse further studies and to make matters worse, his father became ill. Benson’s family used-up most their wealth paying medical bills, leaving them with very little to sustain themselves. As the eldest child in a family of 38 siblings, Benson was therefore forced to take up the responsibility of taking care of his family.
